What components does the app need?

Looking at the layout of the app-screen I would say:
- App
- SearchBar
- Results
- Playlist
- Song
- SongList

In that case the Song and SongList components need to be written in a way that makes them suitable for use in both the Results and the Playlist component. That could be accomplished by writing an parent component class Song and SongList and then extend two Component classes from the Song Component class:
- ResultsSong
- PlaylistSong
and extend two Component classes from the SongList Component class.
- ResultsSongList
- PlaylistSongList
